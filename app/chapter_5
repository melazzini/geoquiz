Android studio gives us three tools to debug our apps: Logcat, Lint and the debugger.

When you encounter runtime exceptions, remember to look at the last Logcat exception
and at the first line of the stack trace. There will be a link to the file and line
when the error happened.

If the crashed occurs when the device is not plugged in, the info will be held for
some time(~10 min or so) in the device, so you can plug the device in and then info will
fill the Logcat window. Probably it will be only the last few lines of the problem.

Using Logs with exceptions we can trace the execution of our(or not our) code in order.

Most android debugging is just like kt debugging. However android has some specific
debugging issues like for example debugging resources.

Android Lint is a static analyser for android code. Lint knows pretty well the android
framework and can inform you about misleading behavior or about xml objects in your app.

Layout inspector and the profiler are other useful tools to examine our apps.
